# project-vet
A university project to create a multimedia system for a mock client (NPC vets) with HTML and CSS that also involved using PHP and MySQL (assisted by phpMyAdmin) to build and control a database using CRUD operations through several web pages (.PHP files). I also created an easy-to-use interface for the database and HTML Form pages with a distinct standardised design throughout the whole website. I used JavaScript to create animations aswell (sounds from hovering over the cat logo). The system ran on a Apache web server (XAMPP), therefore when running you will need your own XAMPP and to move all of the files into 'htdocs' inside your XAMPP directory.
