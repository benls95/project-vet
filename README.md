# project-vet
A university project to create a multimedia system for a mock client (NPC vets) with HTML and CSS that also involved using PHP and MySQL to build and control a database using CRUD operations through several web pages (.PHP files). I also created an easy-to-use interface for the database and HTML Form pages with a distinct standardised design throughout the whole website. I used JavaScript to create animations aswell (sounds from hovering over the cat logo).
